# STEP Import Testing Instructions

## Setup Completed

The STEP file import functionality has been implemented using occt-import-js library.

### What was done:

1. **Installed occt-import-js** - A WebAssembly-based library for importing STEP files using OpenCascade technology
2. **Created STEPHandler class** - Handles STEP file parsing and conversion to Three.js geometry
3. **Added STEP to FileMenu** - Users can now select and import STEP files
4. **Configured Vite** - Added WebAssembly support and proper MIME types
5. **Copied WASM file** - The occt-import-js.wasm file is in the public directory

### How to test:

1. **Start the development server** (already running on port 3010):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open the application** in your browser:
   http://localhost:3010/

3. **Import a STEP file**:
   - Click on "파일" (File) menu
   - Click on "가져오기..." (Import)
   - Select your STEP file: `/Users/kelly/Downloads/1740066362_A1720CBF5C363BF9E7ED8F117F22F535.step`

4. **Check the browser console** for debug information:
   - Press F12 to open Developer Tools
   - Go to Console tab
   - You should see logs about:
     - Loading occt-import-js
     - Initializing the module
     - Parsing the STEP file
     - Converting meshes

### Troubleshooting:

If you still get the "Failed to initialize STEP parser" error:

1. **Check Network tab** in Developer Tools to ensure occt-import-js.wasm is loaded correctly
2. **Verify WASM file location**: The file should be accessible at http://localhost:3010/occt-import-js.wasm
3. **Check Console** for any specific error messages

### Technical Details:

- The library uses WebAssembly to run OpenCascade in the browser
- STEP files are parsed into triangulated meshes
- Each part in the STEP file becomes a separate object in the scene
- Colors and hierarchy are preserved when available

### Next Steps:

Once the basic import works, we can enhance:
1. Progress indicators for large files
2. Better error messages
3. Support for assemblies and part hierarchy
4. Material properties preservation
5. Units conversion options
